        "body": "For starters, let me try to summarize the lessons and intuitions\r\nI've had about ebooks from my release of two novels and most of a\r\nshort story collection online under a Creative Commons license. A\r\nparodist who published a list of alternate titles for the\r\npresentations at this event called this talk, \"eBooks Suck Right\r\nNow,\" [eBooks suck right now] and as funny as that is, I don't\r\nthink it's true.\r\n\r\nNo, if I had to come up with another title for this talk, I'd\r\ncall it: \"Ebooks: You're Soaking in Them.\" [Ebooks: You're\r\nSoaking in Them] That's because I think that the shape of ebooks\r\nto come is almost visible in the way that people interact with\r\ntext today, and that the job of authors who want to become rich\r\nand famous is to come to a better understanding of that shape.\r\n\r\nI haven't come to a perfect understanding. I don't know what the\r\nfuture of the book looks like. But I have ideas, and I'll share\r\nthem with you:\r\n\r\n1. Ebooks aren't marketing. [Ebooks aren't marketing] OK, so\r\nebooks *are* marketing: that is to say that giving away ebooks\r\nsells more books. Baen Books, who do a lot of series publishing,\r\nhave found that giving away electronic editions of the previous\r\ninstallments in their series to coincide with the release of a\r\nnew volume sells the hell out of the new book -- and the\r\nbacklist. And the number of people who wrote to me to tell me\r\nabout how much they dug the ebook and so bought the paper-book\r\nfar exceeds the number of people who wrote to me and said, \"Ha,\r\nha, you hippie, I read your book for free and now I'm not gonna\r\nbuy it.\" But ebooks *shouldn't* be just about marketing: ebooks\r\nare a goal unto themselves. In the final analysis, more people\r\nwill read more words off more screens and fewer words off fewer\r\npages and when those two lines cross, ebooks are gonna have to be\r\nthe way that writers earn their keep, not the way that they\r\npromote the dead-tree editions.\r\n\r\n2. Ebooks complement paper books. [Ebooks complement paper\r\nbooks]. Having an ebook is good. Having a paper book is good.\r\nHaving both is even better. One reader wrote to me and said that\r\nhe read half my first novel from the bound book, and printed the\r\nother half on scrap-paper to read at the beach. Students write to\r\nme to say that it's easier to do their term papers if they can\r\ncopy and paste their quotations into their word-processors. Baen\r\nreaders use the electronic editions of their favorite series to\r\nbuild concordances of characters, places and events.\r\n\r\n3. Unless you own the ebook, you don't 0wn the book [Unless you\r\nown the ebook, you don't 0wn the book]. I take the view that the\r\nbook is a \"practice\" -- a collection of social and economic and\r\nartistic activities -- and not an \"object.\" Viewing the book as a\r\n\"practice\" instead of an object is a pretty radical notion, and\r\nit begs the question: just what the hell is a book? Good\r\nquestion. I write all of my books in a text-editor [TEXT EDITOR\r\nSCREENGRAB] (BBEdit, from Barebones Software -- as fine a\r\ntext-editor as I could hope for). From there, I can convert them\r\ninto a formatted two-column PDF [TWO-UP SCREENGRAB]. I can turn\r\nthem into an HTML file [BROWSER SCREENGRAB]. I can turn them over\r\nto my publisher, who can turn them into galleys, advanced review\r\ncopies, hardcovers and paperbacks. I can turn them over to my\r\nreaders, who can convert them to a bewildering array of formats\r\n[DOWNLOAD PAGE SCREENGRAB]. Brewster Kahle's Internet Bookmobile\r\ncan convert a digital book into a four-color, full-bleed,\r\nperfect-bound, laminated-cover, printed-spine paper book in ten\r\nminutes, for about a dollar. Try converting a paper book to a PDF\r\nor an html file or a text file or a RocketBook or a printout for\r\na buck in ten minutes! It's ironic, because one of the frequently\r\ncited reasons for preferring paper to ebooks is that paper books\r\nconfer a sense of ownership of a physical object. Before the dust\r\nsettles on this ebook thing, owning a paper book is going to feel\r\nless like ownership than having an open digital edition of the\r\ntext.\r\n\r\n4. Ebooks are a better deal for writers. [Ebooks are a better\r\ndeal for writers] The compensation for writers is pretty thin on\r\nthe ground. *Amazing Stories,* Hugo Gernsback's original science\r\nfiction magazine, paid a couple cents a word. Today, science\r\nfiction magazines pay...a couple cents a word. The sums involved\r\nare so minuscule, they're not even insulting: they're *quaint*\r\nand *historical*, like the WHISKEY 5 CENTS sign over the bar at a\r\npioneer village. Some writers do make it big, but they're\r\n*rounding errors* as compared to the total population of sf\r\nwriters earning some of their living at the trade. Almost all of\r\nus could be making more money elsewhere (though we may dream of\r\nearning a stephenkingload of money, and of course, no one would\r\nplay the lotto if there were no winners). The primary incentive\r\nfor writing has to be artistic satisfaction, egoboo, and a desire\r\nfor posterity. Ebooks get you that. Ebooks become a part of the\r\ncorpus of human knowledge because they get indexed by search\r\nengines and replicated by the hundreds, thousands or millions.\r\nThey can be googled.\r\n\r\nEven better: they level the playing field between writers and\r\ntrolls. When Amazon kicked off, many writers got their knickers\r\nin a tight and powerful knot at the idea that axe-grinding yahoos\r\nwere filling the Amazon message-boards with ill-considered slams\r\nat their work -- for, if a personal recommendation is the best\r\nway to sell a book, then certainly a personal condemnation is the\r\nbest way to *not* sell a book. Today, the trolls are still with\r\nus, but now, the readers get to decide for themselves. Here's a\r\nbit of a review of Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom that was\r\nrecently posted to Amazon by \"A reader from Redwood City, CA\":\r\n\r\n[QUOTED TEXT]\r\n\r\n> I am really not sure what kind of drugs critics are\r\n> smoking, or what kind of payola may be involved. But\r\n> regardless of what Entertainment Weekly says, whatever\r\n> this newspaper or that magazine says, you shouldn't\r\n> waste your money. Download it for free from Corey's\r\n> (sic) site, read the first page, and look away in\r\n> disgust -- this book is for people who think Dan\r\n> Brown's Da Vinci Code is great writing.\r\n\r\nBack in the old days, this kind of thing would have really pissed\r\nme off. Axe-grinding, mouth-breathing yahoos, defaming my good\r\nname! My stars and mittens! But take a closer look at that\r\ndamning passage:\r\n\r\n[PULL-QUOTE]\r\n\r\n> Download it for free from Corey's site, read the first\r\n> page\r\n\r\nYou see that? Hell, this guy is *working for me*! [ADDITIONAL\r\nPULL QUOTES] Someone accuses a writer I'm thinking of reading of\r\npaying off Entertainment Weekly to say nice things about his\r\nnovel, \"a surprisingly bad writer,\" no less, whose writing is\r\n\"stiff, amateurish, and uninspired!\" I wanna check that writer\r\nout. And I can. In one click. And then I can make up my own mind.\r\n\r\nYou don't get far in the arts without healthy doses of both ego\r\nand insecurity, and the downside of being able to google up all\r\nthe things that people are saying about your book is that it can\r\nplay right into your insecurities -- \"all these people will have\r\nit in their minds not to bother with my book because they've read\r\nthe negative interweb reviews!\" But the flipside of that is the\r\nego: \"If only they'd give it a shot, they'd see how good it is.\"\r\nAnd the more scathing the review is, the more likely they are to\r\ngive it a shot. Any press is good press, so long as they spell\r\nyour URL right (and even if they spell your name wrong!).\r\n\r\n5. Ebooks need to embrace their nature. [Ebooks need to embrace\r\ntheir nature.] The distinctive value of ebooks is orthagonal to\r\nthe value of paper books, and it revolves around the mix-ability\r\nand send-ability of electronic text. The more you constrain an\r\nebook's distinctive value propositions -- that is, the more you\r\nrestrict a reader's ability to copy, transport or transform an\r\nebook -- the more it has to be valued on the same axes as a\r\npaper-book. Ebooks *fail* on those axes. Ebooks don't beat\r\npaper-books for sophisticated typography, they can't match them\r\nfor quality of paper or the smell of the glue. But just try\r\nsending a paper book to a friend in Brazil, for free, in less\r\nthan a second. Or loading a thousand paper books into a little\r\nstick of flash-memory dangling from your keychain. Or searching a\r\npaper book for every instance of a character's name to find a\r\nbeloved passage. Hell, try clipping a pithy passage out of a\r\npaper book and pasting it into your sig-file.\r\n\r\n6. Ebooks demand a different attention span (but not a shorter\r\none). [Ebooks demand a different attention span (but not a\r\nshorter one).] Artists are always disappointed by their\r\naudience's attention-spans. Go back far enough and you'll find\r\ncuneiform etchings bemoaning the current Sumerian go-go lifestyle\r\nwith its insistence on myths with plotlines and characters and\r\naction, not like we had in the old days. As artists, it would be\r\na hell of a lot easier if our audiences were more tolerant of our\r\npenchant for boring them. We'd get to explore a lot more ideas\r\nwithout worrying about tarting them up with easy-to-swallow\r\nchocolate coatings of entertainment. We like to think of\r\nshortened attention spans as a product of the information age,\r\nbut check this out:\r\n\r\n[Nietzsche quote]\r\n\r\n> To be sure one thing necessary above all: if one is to\r\n> practice reading as an *art* in this way, something\r\n> needs to be un-learned most thoroughly in these days.\r\n\r\nIn other words, if my book is too boring, it's because you're not\r\npaying enough attention. Writers say this stuff all the time, but\r\nthis quote isn't from this century or the last. [Nietzsche quote\r\nwith attribution] It's from the preface to Nietzsche's \"Genealogy\r\nof Morals,\" published in *1887.*\r\n\r\nYeah, our attention-spans are *different* today, but they aren't\r\nnecessarily *shorter*. Warren Ellis's fans managed to hold the\r\nstoryline for Transmetropolitan [Transmet cover] in their minds\r\nfor *five years* while the story trickled out in monthly\r\nfunnybook installments. JK Rowlings's installments on the Harry\r\nPotter series get fatter and fatter with each new volume. Entire\r\nforests are sacrificed to long-running series fiction like Robert\r\nJordan's Wheel of Time books, each of which is approximately\r\n20,000 pages long (I may be off by an order of magnitude one way\r\nor another here). Sure, presidential debates are conducted in\r\nsoundbites today and not the days-long oratory extravaganzas of\r\nthe Lincoln-Douglas debates, but people manage to pay attention\r\nto the 24-month-long presidential campaigns from start to finish.\r\n\r\n7. We need *all* the ebooks. [We need *all* the ebooks] The vast\r\nmajority of the words ever penned are lost to posterity. No one\r\nlibrary collects all the still-extant books ever written and no\r\none person could hope to make a dent in that corpus of written\r\nwork. None of us will ever read more than the tiniest sliver of\r\nhuman literature. But that doesn't mean that we can stick with\r\njust the most popular texts and get a proper ebook revolution.\r\n\r\nFor starters, we're all edge-cases. Sure, we all have the shared\r\ndesire for the core canon of literature, but each of us want to\r\ncomplete that collection with different texts that are as\r\ndistinctive and individualistic as fingerprints. If we all look\r\nlike we're doing the same thing when we read, or listen to music,\r\nor hang out in a chatroom, that's because we're not looking\r\nclosely enough. The shared-ness of our experience is only present\r\nat a coarse level of measurement: once you get into really\r\ngranular observation, there are as many differences in our\r\n\"shared\" experience as there are similarities.\r\n\r\nMore than that, though, is the way that a large collection of\r\nelectronic text differs from a small one: it's the difference\r\nbetween a single book, a shelf full of books and a library of\r\nbooks. Scale makes things different. Take the Web: none of us can\r\nhope to read even a fraction of all the pages on the Web, but by\r\nanalyzing the link structures that bind all those pages together,\r\nGoogle is able to actually tease out machine-generated\r\nconclusions about the relative relevance of different pages to\r\ndifferent queries. None of us will ever eat the whole corpus, but\r\nGoogle can digest it for us and excrete the steaming nuggets of\r\ngoodness that make it the search-engine miracle it is today.\r\n\r\n8. Ebooks are like paper books. [Ebooks are like paper books]. To\r\nround out this talk, I'd like to go over the ways that ebooks are\r\nmore like paper books than you'd expect. One of the truisms of\r\nretail theory is that purchasers need to come into contact with a\r\ngood several times before they buy -- seven contacts is tossed\r\naround as the magic number. That means that my readers have to\r\nhear the title, see the cover, pick up the book, read a review,\r\nand so forth, seven times, on average, before they're ready to\r\nbuy.\r\n\r\nThere's a temptation to view downloading a book as comparable to\r\nbringing it home from the store, but that's the wrong metaphor.\r\nSome of the time, maybe most of the time, downloading the text of\r\nthe book is like taking it off the shelf at the store and looking\r\nat the cover and reading the blurbs (with the advantage of not\r\nhaving to come into contact with the residual DNA and burger king\r\nleft behind by everyone else who browsed the book before you).\r\nSome writers are horrified at the idea that three hundred\r\nthousand copies of my first novel were downloaded and \"only\" ten\r\nthousand or so were sold so far. If it were the case that for\r\never copy sold, thirty were taken home from the store, that would\r\nbe a horrifying outcome, for sure. But look at it another way: if\r\none out of every thirty people who glanced at the cover of my\r\nbook bought it, I'd be a happy author. And I am. Those downloads\r\ncost me no more than glances at the cover in a bookstore, and the\r\nsales are healthy.\r\n\r\nWe also like to think of physical books as being inherently\r\n*countable* in a way that digital books aren't (an irony, since\r\ncomputers are damned good at counting things!). This is\r\nimportant, because writers get paid on the basis of the number of\r\ncopies of their books that sell, so having a good count makes a\r\ndifference. And indeed, my royalty statements contain precise\r\nnumbers for copies printed, shipped, returned and sold.\r\n\r\nBut that's a false precision. When the printer does a run of a\r\nbook, it always runs a few extra at the start and finish of the\r\nrun to make sure that the setup is right and to account for the\r\noccasional rip, drop, or spill. The actual total number of books\r\nprinted is approximately the number of books ordered, but never\r\nexactly -- if you've ever ordered 500 wedding invitations,\r\nchances are you received 500-and-a-few back from the printer and\r\nthat's why.\r\n\r\nAnd the numbers just get fuzzier from there. Copies are stolen.\r\nCopies are dropped. Shipping people get the count wrong. Some\r\ncopies end up in the wrong box and go to a bookstore that didn't\r\norder them and isn't invoiced for them and end up on a sale table\r\nor in the trash. Some copies are returned as damaged. Some are\r\nreturned as unsold. Some come back to the store the next morning\r\naccompanied by a whack of buyer's remorse. Some go to the place\r\nwhere the spare sock in the dryer ends up.\r\n\r\nThe numbers on a royalty statement are actuarial, not actual.\r\nThey represent a kind of best-guess approximation of the copies\r\nshipped, sold, returned and so forth. Actuarial accounting works\r\npretty well: well enough to run the juggernaut banking,\r\ninsurance, and gambling industries on. It's good enough for\r\ndivvying up the royalties paid by musical rights societies for\r\nradio airplay and live performance. And it's good enough for\r\ncounting how many copies of a book are distributed online or off.\r\n\r\nCounts of paper books are differently precise from counts of\r\nelectronic books, sure: but neither one is inherently countable.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, of course, there's the matter of selling books.\r\nHowever an author earns her living from her words, printed or\r\nencoded, she has as her first and hardest task to find her\r\naudience. There are more competitors for our attention than we\r\ncan possibly reconcile, prioritize or make sense of. Getting a\r\nbook under the right person's nose, with the right pitch, is the\r\nhardest and most important task any writer faces.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI care about books, a lot. I started working in libraries and\r\nbookstores at the age of 12 and kept at it for a decade, until I\r\nwas lured away by the siren song of the tech world. I knew I\r\nwanted to be a writer at the age of 12, and now, 20 years later,\r\nI have three novels, a short story collection and a nonfiction\r\nbook out, two more novels under contract, and another book in the\r\nworks. [BOOK COVERS] I've won a major award in my genre, science\r\nfiction, [CAMPBELL AWARD] and I'm nominated for another one, the\r\n2003 Nebula Award for best novelette. [NEBULA]\r\n\r\nI own a *lot* of books. Easily more than 10,000 of them, in\r\nstorage on both coasts of the North American continent [LIBRARY\r\nLADDER]. I have to own them, since they're the tools of my trade:\r\nthe reference works I refer to as a novelist and writer today.\r\nMost of the literature I dig is very short-lived, it disappears\r\nfrom the shelf after just a few months, usually for good. Science\r\nfiction is inherently ephemeral. [ACE DOUBLES]\r\n\r\nNow, as much as I love books, I love computers, too. Computers\r\nare fundamentally different from modern books in the same way\r\nthat printed books are different from monastic Bibles: they are\r\nmalleable. Time was, a \"book\" was something produced by many\r\nmonths' labor by a scribe, usually a monk, on some kind of\r\ndurable and sexy substrate like foetal lambskin. [ILLUMINATED\r\nBIBLE] Gutenberg's xerox machine changed all that, changed a book\r\ninto something that could be simply run off a press in a few\r\nminutes' time, on substrate more suitable to ass-wiping than\r\nexaltation in a place of honor in the cathedral. The Gutenberg\r\npress meant that rather than owning one or two books, a member of\r\nthe ruling class could amass a library, and that rather than\r\npicking only a few subjects from enshrinement in print, a huge\r\nvariety of subjects could be addressed on paper and handed from\r\nperson to person. [KAPITAL/TIJUANA BIBLE]\r\n\r\nMost new ideas start with a precious few certainties and a lot of\r\nspeculation. I've been doing a bunch of digging for certainties\r\nand a lot of speculating lately, and the purpose of this talk is\r\nto lay out both categories of ideas.\r\n\r\nThis all starts with my first novel, Down and Out in the Magic\r\nKingdom [COVER], which came out on January 9, 2003. At that time,\r\nthere was a lot of talk in my professional circles about, on the\r\none hand, the dismal failure of ebooks, and, on the other, the\r\nnew and scary practice of ebook \"piracy.\" [alt.binaries.e-books\r\nscreengrab] It was strikingly weird that no one seemed to notice\r\nthat the idea of ebooks as a \"failure\" was at strong odds with\r\nthe notion that electronic book \"piracy\" was worth worrying\r\nabout: I mean, if ebooks are a failure, then who gives a rats if\r\nintarweb dweebs are trading them on Usenet?\r\n\r\nA brief digression here, on the double meaning of \"ebooks.\" One\r\nmeaning for that word is \"legitimate\" ebook ventures, that is to\r\nsay, rightsholder-authorized editions of the texts of books,\r\nreleased in a proprietary, use-restricted format, sometimes for\r\nuse on a general-purpose PC and sometimes for use on a\r\nspecial-purpose hardware device like the nuvoMedia Rocketbook\r\n[ROCKETBOOK]. The other meaning for ebook is a \"pirate\" or\r\nunauthorized electronic edition of a book, usually made by\r\ncutting the binding off of a book and scanning it a page at a\r\ntime, then running the resulting bitmaps through an optical\r\ncharacter recognition app to convert them into ASCII text, to be\r\ncleaned up by hand. These books are pretty buggy, full of errors\r\nintroduced by the OCR. A lot of my colleagues worry that these\r\nbooks also have deliberate errors, created by mischievous\r\nbook-rippers who cut, add or change text in order to \"improve\"\r\nthe work. Frankly, I have never seen any evidence that any\r\nbook-ripper is interested in doing this, and until I do, I think\r\nthat this is the last thing anyone should be worrying about.\r\n\r\nBack to Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom [COVER]. Well, not yet.\r\nI want to convey to you the depth of the panic in my field over\r\nebook piracy, or \"bookwarez\" as it is known in book-ripper\r\ncircles. Writers were joining the discussion on\r\nalt.binaries.ebooks using assumed names, claiming fear of\r\nretaliation from scary hax0r kids who would presumably screw up\r\ntheir credit-ratings in retaliation for being called thieves. My\r\neditor, a blogger, hacker and\r\nguy-in-charge-of-the-largest-sf-line-in-the-world named Patrick\r\nNielsen Hayden posted to one of the threads in the newsgroup,\r\nsaying, in part [SCREENGRAB]:\r\n\r\n> Pirating copyrighted etext on Usenet and elsewhere is going to\r\n> happen more and more, for the same reasons that everyday folks\r\n> make audio cassettes from vinyl LPs and audio CDs, and\r\n> videocassette copies of store-bought videotapes.  Partly it's\r\n> greed; partly it's annoyance over retail prices; partly it's the\r\n> desire to Share Cool Stuff (a motivation usually underrated by\r\n> the victims of this kind of small-time hand-level piracy).\r\n> Instantly going to Defcon One over it and claiming it's morally\r\n> tantamount to mugging little old ladies in the street will make\r\n> it kind of difficult to move forward from that position when it\r\n> doesn't work.

But the record industry's\r\n> credibility on the subject wasn't exactly enhanced.\r\n\r\nPatrick and I have a long relationship, starting when I was 18\r\nyears old and he kicked in toward a scholarship fund to send me\r\nto a writers' workshop, continuing to a fateful lunch in New York\r\nin the mid-Nineties when I showed him a bunch of Project\r\nGutenberg texts on my Palm Pilot and inspired him to start\r\nlicensing Tor's titles for PDAs [PEANUTPRESS SCREENGRAB], to the\r\nturn-of-the-millennium when he bought and then published my first\r\nnovel (he's bought three more since -- I really like Patrick!).\r\n\r\nRight as bookwarez newgroups were taking off, I was shocked silly\r\nby legal action by one of my colleagues against AOL/Time-Warner\r\nfor carrying the alt.binaries.ebooks newsgroup. This writer\r\nalleged that AOL should have a duty to remove this newsgroup,\r\nsince it carried so many infringing files, and that its failure\r\nto do so made it a contributory infringer, and so liable for the\r\nincredibly stiff penalties afforded by our newly minted copyright\r\nlaws like the No Electronic Theft Act and the loathsome Digital\r\nMillennium Copyright Act or DMCA.\r\n\r\nNow there was a scary thought: there were people out there who\r\nthought the world would be a better place if ISPs were given the\r\nduty of actively policing and censoring the websites and\r\nnewsfeeds their customers had access to, including a requirement\r\nthat ISPs needed to determine, all on their own, what was an\r\nunlawful copyright infringement -- something more usually left up\r\nto judges in the light of extensive amicus briefings from\r\nesteemed copyright scholars [WIND DONE GONE GRAPHIC].\r\n\r\nThis was a stupendously dumb idea, and it offended me down to my\r\nboots. Writers are supposed to be advocates of free expression,\r\nnot censorship. It seemed that some of my colleagues loved the\r\nFirst Amendment, but they were reluctant to share it with the\r\nrest of the world.\r\n\r\nWell, dammit, I had a book coming out, and it seemed to be an\r\nopportunity to try to figure out a little more about this ebook\r\nstuff. On the one hand, ebooks were a dismal failure. On the\r\nother hand, there were more books posted to alt.binaries.ebooks\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nThis leads me into the two certainties I have about ebooks:\r\n\r\n1. More people are reading more words off more screens every day\r\n[GRAPHIC]\r\n\r\n2. Fewer people are reading fewer words off fewer pages every day\r\n[GRAPHIC]\r\n\r\nThese two certainties begged a lot of questions.\r\n\r\n[CHART: EBOOK FAILINGS]\r\n\r\n* Screen resolutions are too low to effectively replace paper\r\n\r\n* People want to own physical books because of their visceral\r\nappeal (often this is accompanied by a little sermonette on how\r\ngood books smell, or how good they look on a bookshelf, or how\r\nevocative an old curry stain in the margin can be)\r\n\r\n* You can't take your ebook into the tub\r\n\r\n* You can't read an ebook without power and a computer\r\n\r\n* File-formats go obsolete, paper has lasted for a long time\r\n\r\nNone of these seemed like very good explanations for the\r\n\"failure\" of ebooks to me. If screen resolutions are too low to\r\nreplace paper, then how come everyone I know spends more time\r\nreading off a screen every year, up to and including my sainted\r\ngrandmother (geeks have a really crappy tendency to argue that\r\ncertain technologies aren't ready for primetime because their\r\ngrandmothers won't use them -- well, my grandmother sends me\r\nemail all the time. She types 70 words per minute, and loves to\r\nshow off grandsonular email to her pals around the pool at her\r\nFlorida retirement condo)?\r\n\r\nThe other arguments were a lot more interesting, though. It\r\nseemed to me that electronic books are *different* from paper\r\nbooks, and have different virtues and failings. Let's think a\r\nlittle about what the book has gone through in years gone by.\r\nThis is interesting because the history of the book is the\r\nhistory of the Enlightenment, the Reformation, the Pilgrims, and,\r\nultimately the colonizing of the Americas and the American\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, there was a time when books were hand-printed\r\non rare leather by monks. The only people who could read them\r\nwere priests, who got a regular eyeful of the really cool\r\ncartoons the monks drew in the margins. The priests read the\r\nbooks aloud, in Latin [LATIN BIBLE] (to a predominantly\r\nnon-Latin-speaking audience) in cathedrals, wreathed in pricey\r\nincense that rose from censers swung by altar boys.\r\n\r\nThen Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press. Martin\r\nLuther turned that press into a revolution. [LUTHER BIBLE] He\r\nprinted Bibles in languages that non-priests could read, and\r\ndistributed them to normal people who got to read the word of God\r\nall on their own. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nHere are some interesting things to note about the advent of the\r\nprinting press:\r\n\r\n[CHART: LUTHER VERSUS THE MONKS]\r\n\r\n* Luther Bibles lacked the manufacturing quality of the\r\nilluminated Bibles. They were comparatively cheap and lacked the\r\ntypographical expressiveness that a really talented monk could\r\nbring to bear when writing out the word of God\r\n\r\n* Luther Bibles were utterly unsuited to the traditional use-case\r\nfor Bibles. A good Bible was supposed to reinforce the authority\r\nof the man at the pulpit. It needed heft, it needed\r\nimpressiveness, and most of all, it needed rarity.\r\n\r\n* The user-experience of Luther Bibles sucked. There was no\r\nincense, no altar boys, and who (apart from the priesthood) knew\r\nthat reading was so friggin' hard on the eyes?\r\n\r\n* Luther Bibles were a lot less trustworthy than the illuminated\r\nnumbers. Anyone with a press could run one off, subbing in any\r\napocryphal text he wanted -- and who knew how accurate that\r\ntranslation was? Monks had an entire Papacy behind them, running\r\na quality-assurance operation that had stood Europe in good stead\r\nfor centuries.\r\n\r\nIn the late nineties, I went to conferences where music execs\r\npatiently explained that Napster was doomed, because you didn't\r\nget any cover-art or liner-notes with it, you couldn't know if\r\nthe rip was any good, and sometimes the connection would drop\r\nmid-download. I'm sure that many Cardinals espoused the points\r\nraised above with equal certainty.\r\n\r\nWhat the record execs and the cardinals missed was all the ways\r\nthat Luther Bibles kicked ass:\r\n\r\n[CHART: WHY LUTHER BIBLES KICKED ASS]\r\n\r\n* They were cheap and fast. Loads of people could acquire them\r\nwithout having to subject themselves to the authority and\r\napproval of the Church\r\n\r\n* They were in languages that non-priests could read. You no\r\nlonger had to take the Church's word for it when its priests\r\nexplained what God really meant\r\n\r\n* They birthed a printing-press ecosystem in which lots of books\r\nflourished. New kinds of fiction, poetry, politics, scholarship\r\nand so on were all enabled by the printing presses whose initial\r\npopularity was spurred by Luther's ideas about religion.\r\n\r\nNote that all of these virtues are orthagonal to the virtues of a\r\nmonkish Bible. That is, none of the things that made the\r\nGutenberg press a success were the things that made monk-Bibles a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nBy the same token, the reasons to love ebooks have precious\r\nlittle to do with the reasons to love paper books.\r\n\r\n[CHART: WHY EBOOKS KICK ASS]\r\n\r\n* They are easy to share. Secrets of Ya-Ya Sisterhood went from a\r\nmidlist title to a bestseller by being passed from hand to hand\r\nby women in reading circles. Slashdorks and other netizens have\r\nsocial life as rich as reading-circlites, but they don't ever get\r\nto see each other face to face; the only kind of book they can\r\npass from hand to hand is an ebook. What's more, the single\r\nfactor most correlated with a purchase is a recommendation from a\r\nfriend -- getting a book recommended by a pal is more likely to\r\nsell you on it than having read and enjoyed the preceding volume\r\nin a series!\r\n\r\n* They are easy to slice and dice. This is where the Mac\r\nevangelist in me comes out -- minority platforms matter. It's a\r\ntruism of the Napsterverse that most of the files downloaded are\r\nbog-standard top-40 tracks, like 90 percent or so, and I believe\r\nit. We all want to popular music. That's why it's popular. But\r\nthe interesting thing is the other ten percent. Bill Gates told\r\nthe New York Times that Microsoft lost the search wars by doing\r\n\"a good job on the 80 percent of common queries and ignor[ing]\r\nthe other stuff. But it's the remaining 20 percent that counts,\r\nbecause that's where the quality perception is.\" Why did Napster\r\ncaptivate so many of us? Not because it could get us the top-40\r\ntracks that we could hear just by snapping on the radio: it was\r\nbecause 80 percent of the music ever recorded wasn't available\r\nfor sale anywhere in the world, and in that 80 percent were all\r\nthe songs that had ever touched us, all the earworms that had\r\nbeen lodged in our hindbrains, all the stuff that made us smile\r\nwhen we heard it. Those songs are different for all of us, but\r\nthey share the trait of making the difference between a\r\ncompelling service and, well, top-40 Clearchannel radio\r\nprogramming. It was the minority of tracks that appealed to the\r\nmajority of us. By the same token, the malleability of electronic\r\ntext means that it can be readily repurposed: you can throw it on\r\na webserver or convert it to a format for your favorite PDA; you\r\ncan ask your computer to read it aloud or you can search the text\r\nfor a quotation to cite in a book report or to use in your sig.\r\nIn other words, most people who download the book do so for the\r\npredictable reason, and in a predictable format -- say, to sample\r\na chapter in the HTML format before deciding whether to buy the\r\nbook -- but the thing that differentiates a boring e-text\r\nexperience from an exciting one is the minority use -- printing\r\nout a couple chapters of the book to bring to the beach rather\r\nthan risk getting the hardcopy wet and salty.\r\n\r\nTool-makers and software designers are increasingly aware of the\r\nnotion of \"affordances\" in design. You can bash a nail into the\r\nwall with any heavy, heftable object from a rock to a hammer to a\r\ncast-iron skillet. However, there's something about a hammer that\r\ncries out for nail-bashing, it has affordances that tilt its\r\nholder towards swinging it. And, as we all know, when all you\r\nhave is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail.\r\n\r\nThe affordance of a computer -- the thing it's designed to do --\r\nis to slice-and-dice collections of bits. The affordance of the\r\nInternet is to move bits at very high speed around the world at\r\nlittle-to-no cost. It follows from this that the center of the\r\nebook experience is going to involve slicing and dicing text and\r\nsending it around.\r\n\r\nCopyright lawyers have a word for these activities: infringement.\r\nThat's because copyright gives creators a near-total monopoly\r\nover copying and remixing of their work, pretty much forever\r\n(theoretically, copyright expires, but in actual practice,\r\ncopyright gets extended every time the early Mickey Mouse\r\ncartoons are about to enter the public domain, because Disney\r\nswings a very big stick on the Hill).\r\n\r\nThis is a huge problem. The biggest possible problem. Here's why:\r\n\r\n[CHART: HOW BROKEN COPYRIGHT SCREWS EVERYONE]\r\n\r\n* Authors freak out. Authors have been schooled by their peers\r\nthat strong copyright is the only thing that keeps them from\r\ngetting savagely rogered in the marketplace. This is pretty much\r\ntrue: it's strong copyright that often defends authors from their\r\npublishers' worst excesses. However, it doesn't follow that\r\nstrong copyright protects you from your *readers*.\r\n\r\n* Readers get indignant over being called crooks. Seriously.\r\nYou're a small businessperson. Readers are your customers.\r\nCalling them crooks is bad for business.\r\n\r\n* Publishers freak out. Publishers freak out, because they're in\r\nthe business of grabbing as much copyright as they can and\r\nhanging onto it for dear life because, dammit, you never know.\r\nThis is why science fiction magazines try to trick writers into\r\nsigning over improbable rights for things like theme park rides\r\nand action figures based on their work -- it's also why literary\r\nagents are now asking for copyright-long commissions on the books\r\nthey represent: copyright covers so much ground and takes to long\r\nto shake off, who wouldn't want a piece of it?\r\n\r\n* Liability goes through the roof. Copyright infringement,\r\nespecially on the Net, is a supercrime. It carries penalties of\r\n$150,000 per infringement, and aggrieved rights-holders and their\r\nrepresentatives have all kinds of special powers, like the\r\nability to force an ISP to turn over your personal information\r\nbefore showing evidence of your alleged infringement to a judge.\r\nThis means that anyone who suspects that he might be on the wrong\r\nside of copyright law is going to be terribly risk-averse:\r\npublishers non-negotiably force their authors to indemnify them\r\nfrom infringement claims and go one better, forcing writers to\r\nprove that they have \"cleared\" any material they quote, even in\r\nthe case of brief fair-use quotations, like song-titles at the\r\nopening of chapters. The result is that authors end up assuming\r\npotentially life-destroying liability, are chilled from quoting\r\nmaterial around them, and are scared off of public domain texts\r\nbecause an honest mistake about the public-domain status of a\r\nwork carries such a terrible price.\r\n\r\n* Posterity vanishes. In the Eldred v. Ashcroft Supreme Court\r\nhearing last year, the court found that 98 percent of the works\r\nin copyright are no longer earning money for anyone, but that\r\nfiguring out who these old works belong to with the degree of\r\ncertainty that you'd want when one mistake means total economic\r\napocalypse would cost more than you could ever possibly earn on\r\nthem. That means that 98 percent of works will largely expire\r\nlong before the copyright on them does. Today, the names of\r\nscience fiction's ancestral founders -- Mary Shelley, Arthur\r\nConan Doyle, Edgar Allan Poe, Jules Verne, HG Wells -- are still\r\nknown, their work still a part of the discourse. Their spiritual\r\ndescendants from Hugo Gernsback onward may not be so lucky -- if\r\ntheir work continues to be \"protected\" by copyright, it might\r\njust vanish from the face of the earth before it reverts to the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\nThis isn't to say that copyright is bad, but that there's such a\r\nthing as good copyright and bad copyright, and that sometimes,\r\ntoo much good copyright is a bad thing. It's like chilis in soup:\r\na little goes a long way, and too much spoils the broth.\r\n\r\nFrom the Luther Bible to the first phonorecords, from radio to\r\nthe pulps, from cable to MP3, the world has shown that its first\r\npreference for new media is its \"democratic-ness\" -- the ease\r\nwith which it can reproduced.\r\n\r\n(And please, before we get any farther, forget all that business\r\nabout how the Internet's copying model is more disruptive than\r\nthe technologies that proceeded it. For Christ's sake, the\r\nVaudeville performers who sued Marconi for inventing the radio\r\nhad to go from a regime where they had *one hundred percent*\r\ncontrol over who could get into the theater and hear them perform\r\nto a regime where they had *zero* percent control over who could\r\nbuild or acquire a radio and tune into a recording of them\r\nperforming. For that matter, look at the difference between a\r\nmonkish Bible and a  Luther Bible -- next to that phase-change,\r\nNapster is peanuts)\r\n\r\nBack to democratic-ness. Every successful new medium has traded\r\noff its artifact-ness -- the degree to which it was populated by\r\nbespoke hunks of atoms, cleverly nailed together by master\r\ncraftspeople -- for ease of reproduction. Piano rolls weren't as\r\nexpressive as good piano players, but they scaled better -- as\r\ndid radio broadcasts, pulp magazines, and MP3s. Liner notes, hand\r\nillumination and leather bindings are nice, but they pale in\r\ncomparison to the ability of an individual to actually get a\r\ncopy of her own.\r\n\r\nWhich isn't to say that old media die. Artists still\r\nhand-illuminate books; master pianists still stride the boards at\r\nCarnegie Hall, and the shelves burst with tell-all biographies of\r\nmusicians that are richer in detail than any liner-notes booklet.\r\nThe thing is, when all you've got is monks, every book takes on\r\nthe character of a monkish Bible. Once you invent the printing\r\npress, all the books that are better-suited to movable type\r\nmigrate into that new form. What's left behind are those items\r\nthat are best suited to the old production scheme: the plays that\r\n*need* to be plays, the books that are especially lovely on\r\ncreamy paper stitched between covers, the music that is most\r\nenjoyable performed live and experienced in a throng of humanity.\r\n\r\nIncreased democratic-ness translates into decreased control: it's\r\na lot harder to control who can copy a book once there's a\r\nphotocopier on every corner than it is when you need a monastery\r\nand several years to copy a Bible. And that decreased control\r\ndemands a new copyright regime that rebalances the rights of\r\ncreators with their audiences.\r\n\r\nFor example, when the VCR was invented, the courts affirmed a new\r\ncopyright exemption for time-shifting; when the radio was\r\ninvented, the Congress granted an anti-trust exemption to the\r\nrecord labels in order to secure a blanket license; when cable TV\r\nwas invented, the government just ordered the broadcasters to\r\nsell the cable-operators access to programming at a fixed rate.\r\n\r\nCopyright is perennially out of date, because its latest rev was\r\ngenerated in response to the last generation of technology. The\r\ntemptation to treat copyright as though it came down off the\r\nmountain on two stone tablets (or worse, as \"just like\" real\r\nproperty) is deeply flawed, since, by definition, current\r\ncopyright only considers the last generation of tech.\r\n\r\nSo, are bookwarez in violation of copyright law? Duh. Is this the\r\nend of the world? *Duh*. If the Catholic church can survive the\r\nprinting press, science fiction will certainly weather the advent\r\nof bookwarez.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLagniappe [Lagniappe]\r\n\r\nWe're almost done here, but there's one more thing I'd like to do\r\nbefore I get off the stage. [Lagniappe: an unexpected bonus or\r\nextra] Think of it as a \"lagniappe\" -- a little something extra\r\nto thank you for your patience.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago, I released my first novel, Down and Out in the\r\nMagic Kingdom, on the net, under the terms of the most\r\nrestrictive Creative Commons license available.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n*** END: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n\n Photo courtesy unsplash.com\n",
